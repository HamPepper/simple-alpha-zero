<h2>Abstract</h2>
<!-- 
One or two sentences on the motivation behind the problem you are solving. 
One or two sentences describing the approach you took. 
One or two sentences on the main result you obtained. -->

<p> 
  We were inspired by DeepMind's AlphaZero - a general algorithm that can learn to master a game just from its rules, without any prior knowledge or expert-played games to learn from. 
  The AlphaZero algorithm uses a combination of deep convolutional neural networks and tree search, leveraging Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) and a deep learned heuristic in order to traverse through various promising game states.
  AlphaZero is a generalization of DeepMind's AlphaGo Zero, a self-learning algorithm specifically designed for the game of Go.</p>

<p> 
  For our project, we implemented the AlphaZero algorithm completely from scratch, and then tested it on small games such as Tic-Tac-Toe and Connect-4. 
  Additionally, we experiment using a state of the art Squeeze and Excitation Network (SENet) as part our architecture.
  This is a novel angle, as SENets have not been integrated with AlphaZero in existing literature.
</p>

<p> 
  Our results show that our implementation is able to successfully self-learn strong policies for Tic-Tac-Toe and Connect-4. 
</p>

<br>
<h2> Introduction and Motivation </h2>
<h4>What did you try to do? What problem did you try to solve? Articulate your objectives using absolutely no jargon.</h4>
<p>
  Our goal was to independently re-create an implementation of AlphaZero and test it on games like Tic-Tac-Toe and Connect-4.
  Additionally, we wanted to evaluate performance across different network architecutres, including the state of the art Squeeze and Excitation Network (SENet).
</p>

<p>
   Since the algorithm is generalized, we should be able to plug AlphaZero into any discrete, deterministic game with perfect information and find powerful policies through self-play.
   Just like the results of the original paper, we wanted to show that the algorithm would be able to learn how to play (and win!) the game based solely on its game-play rules - we would not provide the algorithm with any other information such as game trajectories by grandmasters etc.

  </p>

<h4>How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?</h4>
<p>
  Currently, AlphaZero is at the forefront of systems that can learn by themself (i.e. through self-play) and master highly complex games (such as Chess and Go).
  AlphaZero's key benefit lies in the fact that it does not use any annotated data to learn strong policies. 
</p><p>
  The AlphaZero algorithm is straightforward, but nobody has been able to replicate the results that DeepMind achieved on Chess or Go because of the sheer computational power required.
  This is also our main limitation - we will not be able to exactly replicate DeepMind's results because we do not have Tensor Process Units (TPUs) at our disposal.
  There are notable community-driven efforts to pool computation for the purposes of independently replicating DeepMind's performance with Go and Chess, namely Leela Zero and Leela Chess Zero, respectively.
  There are also several groups that have successfully leveraged AlphaZero to learn easier games like Othello.
  Of the available open source AlphaZero implementations, most are intricate, poorly documented, untested, or designed specifically for use with one game.
</p>
<p> 
  AlphaZero and MCTS are promising new self-play algorithms.
  Historically, Alpha-Beta Search and the Minimax strategy have been extensively used for machine playing of two-player games.
  Famously, IBM's Deep Blue program used Alpha-Beta search to defeat world chess champion Garry Kasparov in 1997.
</p>

<p> 
    Regarding the games we will be learning, both Connect-4 and Tic-Tac-Toe are solved games. A solved game is one whose outcome (win, loss or tie) can be accurately determined from any position, assuming that both players play perfectly. In Connect-4, the first player can force a win, as proved in 1988 by James Allen and Victor Allis (independently of each other); while Tic-Tac-Toe is trivially solvable because its game tree is relatively small. 
  </p>
  

<h4>Who cares? If you are successful, what difference will it make?</h4>

<p> 
  Our aim is to implement from scratch a simple, fully-tested, and modular AlphaZero environment.
  We intend this setup to provide good headway for future AlphaZero research, like testing the potential of different types of deep networks, introducing multi-player games, etc.
  In the code bank, there is an extensive test bed that can be scaled up (perhaps using TPUs),
  and the modular nature of the code means that it is straightforward to swap out the game being learnt and the network being used to train. 
  </p>
  <p>
    Additionally, we can contribute the first documented results of an SENet being used within AlphaZero.
    We hope that our results with SENet will be exciting and encourage other researchers to integrate squeeze-and-excitation into a new generation of AlphaZero agents.
  </p>

<br>
<h2> Background </h2>
<h4> Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) </h4>
<p> 
  At the heart of the AlphaZero algorithm is Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) - a tree searching methodology used to determine the best move to make from the given board state. To understand how AlphaZero innovates on MCTS, it is important to first understand how vanilla MCTS works. 
</p>

<p> 
  MCTS was developed in 2006 by Remi Coulom as a domain-independent policy search algorithm. 
  MCTS works with games that are discrete, deterministic and have perfect information - this means that they must have distinct moves and positions, have fixed outcomes for each move, and players must compete against one another but can see everything that happens. 
  Examples include Chess, Checkers, Go, Tic-Tac-Toe, Connect-4, and many other board games.
</p>

<br><br>
<div style="text-align: center;">
<img style="height: 200px;" alt="" src="images/game.png">
</div>
<br><br>

<p> 
  The MCTS API: given the current state of a game board, MCTS returns a distribution over actions indicating which moves are most likely to result in a win.
  To do this, MCTS iteratively builds a search tree node by node, starting from the current board state. In this tree, nodes are game states and directed edges are legal moves.
  This construction is done in a way that balances exploration and exploitation.
  For each edge we maintain W which is the sum of rewards from taking that action, and N which is the number of times we took that action. W and N are accumulated across iterations.
</p>

<p>
  
  After many iterations, we can weight the actions from our current state by the number of times MCTS visited them.
  The action with the highest visit count has the highest probability of leading us to a win.
  Below is an example of how this might work from the starting state of Tic-Tac-Toe after 820 iterations.
</p>
  
  <table text-align="center" style="margin-top: 30px; margin-bottom: 30px;">
    <tr><td align="center"><b>Iteration 0</b></td><td></td><td align="center"><b>Iteration 820</b></td></tr>
    <tr><td><img src="images/iteration0.png"/></td><td><img src="images/squiggle.png"/></td><td><img src="images/iteration820.png"/></td></tr>
  </table>


  <p>
  This policy search requires some thinking time - the more iterations you give MCTS, the better its policy will be.
  In each iteration, a series of Selection, Expansion, Simulation, and Backpropagation steps occur.
  Each iteration updates the search tree and improves our policy.
</p>


<br><br>
<div style="text-align: center;">

<img style="height: 250px;" alt="" src="images/mcts_iterations.png">
</div>
<br><br>

<p>
  So we start at a board state and begin running iterations of MCTS.
  <b>An interation is made up of the following 4 steps.</b>
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p> 
      <b>Selection.</b> During selection, we crawl down our search tree, choosing nodes based off a simple exploration/exploitation heuristic; the action with the highest heuristic value gets chosen.
      The Selection phase stops once we hit a leaf node in our search tree. This leaf represents a board state and is what gets "Selected".
    </p>

    <p> 
      When MCTS is run on a new game, there will only be one node its search tree to begin with.
      This node is is the game's starting state s<sub>init</sub>, and because it is the only node (and hence leaf) in the search tree so far, it trivially gets Selected. For a game like Tic-Tac-Toe this initial state would be an empty 3 by 3 board.
    </p>

    <br><br>
    <div style="text-align: center;">
    <img style="height: 200px;" alt="" src="images/mcts1.png">
    </div>
    <br><br>

    <p> 
        In the above example, we did not have to worry about choosing an action to traverse since the root was a leaf.
        Typically, we will have to traverse down our search tree to find a leaf, and a heuristic will guide which actions get selected at each level.
      The main challenge during Selection is maintaining a balance between the exploitation of moves we have found to be valuable and exploration of moves with relatively few simulations. 
      
      
      The upper confidence tree (UCT) score is a popular MCTS heuristic that uses the edge statistics (W and N) to trade off exploitation (the first term of the expression) with exploration (the second term of the expression).
      The equation for UCT is shown below, where W<sub>i</sub> is the accumulated reward of edge i, N<sub>i</sub> is the visit count of the edge i, and N<sub>p</sub> is the sum of visit counts across all edges sharing a parent with i.
    </p>

    <br><br>
    <div style="text-align: center;">
    <img style="height: 100px;" alt="" src="images/uct.png">
    </div>
    <br><br>

    <p> 
      We have a free parameter here c. Having a low value for c will encourage the algorithm to choose nodes with a high value W (exploit), while a low c value will encourage the search to pick nodes with a low visited count N (explore). The value of c is often set empirically. 
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p> 
      <b>Expansion</b>. 
      If our Selected node is not a terminal node (the game was won/lost/tied), then add each of its children to the tree.
      Again, a child is just a state you can reach through a legal move.
      
    </p>

    <p> 
      In the case of Tic-Tac-Toe, we would expand our selected node, s<sub>init</sub>. Since there are 9 possible actions that can be taken from this state (9 positions that player X can make a move), and s<sub>init</sub> is not a terminal state, we add all 9 states to s<sub>init</sub>, as shown below. 
      The N and W statistics are shown along each edge, as well as the UCT heuristic H which is computed from N and W.
    </p>

    <br><br>
    <div style="text-align: center;">
    <img style="height: 350px;" alt="" src="images/expansion.png">
    </div>
    <br><br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p> 
        <b>Simulation.</b> 
        Expansion opened up a pool of unexplored children, and we would like to associate values with these new actions.
        The first thing we do is use our heuristic to select which newly created child to simulate. If our heuristic is UCT, this just means picking one at random.

        From this selected child we do a Monte Carlo playout - we randomly select moves until we reach a terminal state, at which point the game is won (+1), lost (-1), or tied (+0). 
        These simulated moves are not saved anywhere in the tree - they are used strictly for assigning a value to the child.
        If the selected node was already a terminal node, you can skip this simulation.
    </p>

    <p> 
      Returning to our Tic-Tac-Toe example, the circled node is the one that gets randomly picked for simulation. 
    </p>

    <br><br>
    <div style="text-align: center;">
    <img style="height: 400px;" alt="" src="images/selection.png">
    </div>
    <br><br>

    <p> 
      We now carry out the Simulation step by randomly playing out the game until we reach a terminal state.
    </p>

    <br><br>
    <div style="text-align: center;">
    <img style="height: 200px;" alt="" src="images/playout.png">
    </div>
    <br><br>

  </li>

  <li>
    <p> 
      <b>Backpropagation.</b> The Monte Carlo playout provides us with information about the new child's value, specifically whether we won (+1), lost (-1) or tied (+0) after random play from that state. This outcome is added to the W statistic of each edge we traversed to get to the expanded state. 
      The algorithm keeps track of the current player at each level and flips the sign of the reward as needed before adding it to W. Each N along the path is also incremented to indicate each move on the path was explored.
      And that's it. By updating these statistics, Backpropagation helps inform the heuristic for future iterations. 
    </p>

    <p> 
      As we follow our Tic-Tac-Toe example, we now see the W and N values updated, which also updates the heuristic H.
    </p>

    <br><br>
    <div style="text-align: center;">
    <img style="height: 450px;" alt="" src="images/backpropagation.png">
    </div>
    <br><br>

  </li>
</ol>

<p> 
  The MCTS will continue to run multiple iterations of Selection, Expansion, Simulation, and Backpropagation until time runs out and we are left with a policy at our root.
  At this point we take our turn in the game either by selecting the action that with the highest visit count or by sampling from our policy distribution.
  We move on to the next game state, which becomes our root node, and repeat MCTS all over again to find our next best move. 
</p>

<h4> The Squeeze and Excitation Network (SENet) </h4>

<p> 
  Our implementation of AlphaZero is highly modular. The modularity made it much easier to test different games and novel networks to train. One of the networks we plugged into our system was the Squeeze and Excitation Network (SENet). The introduction of SENets created waves when they were used in the ImageNet competition of 2017, improving the results from the previous year by a staggering 25%. 
</p>

<p> 
  The main crux of the SENet is that it introduces parameters into each channel of a convolutional block, so that the network can adaptively adjust the weight of each feature map (a process known as feature recalibration).
</p>

<p> 
  In general, convolutional neural networks efficiently extract hierarchical information from their filters - in class we have seen that layers closer to the start of the network tend to find low-level features such as edges, while layers towards the end of the network, closer to the loss layer, are attuned to detecting faces or more complex scenes. The spatial and channel information are used in conjunction, and the network equally weights these channels when output maps are being created. 
</p>

<p> 
  With the SENet, the aim is to weight each channel adaptively, so that it is more aware of the content in each channel. It wants to explicitly model channel interdependencies between its convolutional features. A simple example would be adding one parameter to each channel and linearly scaling it based on how relevant each channel is. 
</p>

<p> 
  In reality, the process is a little more complicated. A holistic understanding of each channel is garnered by squeezing the feature maps into a single value (by Average Pooling). Squeezing (i.e Average Pooling) gives rise to a vector whose size is equal to the number of original convolutional channels. This vector is passed through a two-layer neural network and a sigmoid, creating a vector of the same size. The contents of this output vector are used as the weights of the original feature maps (they are now scaled based on relevance).
</p>

<p>
  The diagram below shows how a ResNet module would be updated with the concepts from the SENet (adding the fully connected layers and the sigmoid layer).
</p>

<img style="height: 350px;" alt="" src="images/senet1.png">
</div>
<br><br>

<p> 
  A complete SENet is then created by stacking multiple of these layers (now called an SE Block, since it augments convolutional blocks) on top of each other.
</p>

<p>
  A succient overview of the SENet, by the authors, is shown below.

<h4> AlphaGo Zero and AlphaZero </h4>
<p> 
  Vanilla MCTS performs quite well. One of its earliest successes was in Crazy Stone, a Go agent that defeated a professional Go player in 2008, with a small handicap. These results showed that MCTS was a promising direction that could be further pursued.
</p>

<p>
  With this knowledge, DeepMind innovated. They augmented the UCT MCTS heuristic with a deep network and policy. They train the parameters of the deep neural network through self-play reinforcement learning. With enough playouts, the UCT score will allow for the exploration of all important game positions in any game and find their values using MCTS. However, by using deep convolutional neural networks, fewer game positions need to be explored (to give rise to similar results), because the network 'learns' the approximate values that positions will have. DeepMind created a really deep neural network architecture, inspired by ResNet (a network that had previously performed really well on the ImageNet challenge and other computer vision related tasks). The beauty of their design means that as the deep network gets better over time, it also informs MCTS and makes the search process more efficient. The self-reinforcing cycle quickly snowballs and makes for an extremely powerfull system.

<br><br>

<br>
<h2>Approach</h2>
<h4>What did you do exactly? How did you solve the problem? Why did you think it would be successful? Is anything new in your approach?</h4>
<p> 
  We implemented AlphaZero from scratch and used it train an agent to master Tic-Tac-Toe and Connect-4. Our implementation was programmed in Python, Numpy, and Pytorch. We believed that we would succeed because both games have a relatively small branching factors and few game states compared to a game like Go. We directly compare the performance of the algorithm across three different network architectures (including a SENet, which, from our survey of literature, has not been tried before).
</p>

<h4>What problems did you anticipate? What problems did you encounter? Did the very first thing you tried work?</h4>
<p> 
  One problem we anticipated was computation time. From the AlphaZero paper, training an agent to play Go took just 8 hours to master the game - but required over 5000 TPUs.
  The only resource we had access to was a GTX 1070 in a desktop machine running Ubuntu.
  It would take approximately 22 years to replicate DeepMind's Go program on our hardware!
  It was important to limit the scope of this project to something feasible with our hardware by picking a simpler game.
  Training a Tic-Tac-Toe agent was our immediate goal, and training a Connect-4 agent was our reach goal.
  Go has has an average branching factor 250 and about 2*10<sup>170</sup> game states.
  Compare that to the simplicity of the other games:
  Tic-Tac-Toe has a maximum branching factor of 9 and about 5000 game states, and Connect-4 has a maximum branching factor of 6 and about 4.5 trillion game states. 
</p>

<p> 
  Another problem we anticipated was the complexity of implementing AlphaZero from scratch.
  There are many intricate components like MCTS that are bug-prone.
  If any component was bugged, the entire AlphaZero pipeline would fail.
  To couteract this, we wrote extensive unit tests for each component during development.
  In total, we created 31 tests for our implementation.
</p>

<p> 
  An unanticipated problem that we encountered was AlphaZero's sensitivity to certain hyperparameters.

  AlphaZero works by generating games of self-play as training data, and then updating its network based off that experience.
  One tricky hyperparameter we had to tune was the number of self-play examples generated per network between gradient descent updates.
  The AlphaZero paper offered no guidance on this value, so we initially started it at 1 - that is, 1 game generated per network followed by an update.
  We found that at this frequency learning was unstable - policies would change drastically between subsequent networks, impairing learning.
  After some experimenting, we found that generating at least 30 training data games per iteration enabled stable learning.
</p>

<h4>Hyperparameters</h4>
<p> 
  One of the attractive qualities of the AlphaZero paper is that DeepMind used the same hyperparameters across each game they trained it on.
  Similarly, after much trial and error, we arrived at a set of hyperparameters that worked well across different games and networks.
  Experimenting with different hyperparameters is expensive because AlphaZero takes a long time to train, so once we discovered a set of hyperparameters that yielded good performance across many games and networks we stopped tweaking.
</p>

<br>
Algorithm Parameters
<ul>
  <li>Number of self-play games generated per network: 30</li>
  <li>Number of batches per update: 1000</li>
  <li>MCTS iterations per move: 50 (Set as 800 in AlphaZero paper)</li>
  <li>cpuct (value of free parameter c, in UCT heuristic): 3</li>
</ul>
<br>
Network Parameters
<ul>
  <li>Optimizer: Adam (SGD+Momentum in AlphaZero paper)</li>
  <li>Learning rate: 1e-3 (1e-2 -> 1e-4 decay in AlphaZero paper)</li>
  <li>Batch size: 64 (2048 in AlphaZero paper)</li>
  <li>L2 regularization: 1e-4 (Same as AlphaZero paper)</li>
</ul>

<p>
  To avoid overfitting, L2 regularization is set to 1e-4 as suggested in the AlphaZero paper.
  Generalization is important for this task because the network will only see a small subset of all possible boards during training.
  Generalization empowers the network to have a good sense as to whether a novel state encountered during play is promising, which is useful if the game enters unknown territory.
</p>

<br>
<h2>Experiments and Results: Overview</h2>
<h4>How did you measure success? What experiments were used? What were the results, both quantitative and qualitative? Did you succeed? Did you fail? Why?</h4>
<p>
  Since we experimented with two separate games, we will report the results for both games separately. 
  Overall, our implementation of AlphaZero was successful with both games.
  We experimented with three different network architectures, described below.
</p>
<table border="1" align="center" style="margin-top: 30px; margin-bottom: 30px;">
  <tr>
    <th>Name</th> <th>Description</th> <th>Number of parameters</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>MLP</td> <td>Two-layer fully connected network with 200 hidden units.</td> <td>7,610</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
      <td>Mini/Small VGG</td> <td>Two-layer convolutional network with 2x2 or 4x4 filters.</td> <td>~40,000</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
      <td>SENet</td> <td>A deeper (4-layer) squeeze-and-excitation convolutional network.</td> <td>11,260,354</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>
  These models are quite anemic compared to the 40-layer ResNet used by DeepMind, but our hope was that simpler games could be learned with simpler models.
</p>
<br>
<h2>Experiments and Results: Tic-Tac-Toe</h2>
<h5>About Tic-Tac-Toe</h5>
<p>
  Tic-Tac-Toe is played on a 3x3 board. Players alternate turns placing an X or O in an open spot.
  If a player gets three of their symbols in a row, they win.
  Tic-Tac-Toe is a solved game - optimal play from both players will result in a tie.
</p>
<h5> Training Error </h5>
<p>
  One measure of success is how well the network learned from self-play data.
  We can analyze the training loss curve of our networks.
  The lower the loss achieved, the more successful of a heuristic was learned.
  Training error only tells us how successful our network is during self-play - it does not necessarily generalize to real-world games.
  That said, assuming proper regularization, lower training error means a smarter agent.
</p>
<center><img src="images/ttt_error.png"></center>

<p>
  Regardless of architecture choice, with more and more iterations of training, train error decreases.
  This result on its own is exciting; deep RL techniques are notoriously unstable, yet looking at this graph we see stable learning.
  Network architecture has a noticeable impact on error - the two layer fully-connected MLP has higher error after the same number of iterations as the shallow CNN (MiniVGG) or deep CNN (SENet).
  For a simple game like Tic-Tac-Toe, making our network deeper does not confer a significant advantage over using a shallower network.
</p>
<h5> Generalized Performance </h5>
<p>
  So the convolutional networks have lower self-play training error, but we would like to know how well they generalize.
  To test the general strength of each network, we developed a novel benchmark: each agent plays against vanilla MCTS agents of increasing strength and records its win rate.
  Vanilla MCTS agents do not use a deep heuristic; they use the UCT heuristic discussed earlier.
  After each turn, the number of MCTS iterations used by the opponent doubles, starting from 10 and ending at 20,480. This allows the agent to use much more time to explore possible moves (a few minutes) before taking a turn.
  In this way, we can compare the relative strengths of the networks against an identical opponent to get a better idea of how well their strategies generalize outside of self-play.
  The performance of these networks against increasingly stronger opponents is plotted below.
</p>

<table align="center" style="margin-top:30px; margin-bottom:30px">
<td>
<img src="images/ttt_strength.png" align="center"/></td>
<td>
<table border="1" align="center" style="margin-top: 30px; margin-bottom: 30px;">
  <tr><th>Network</th> <th>Average Win Rate</th></tr>
  <tr><td>None (UCT) (Control)</td> <td>0.396</td></tr>
  <tr><td>MLP</td> <td>0.542</td></tr>
  <tr><td>MiniVGG</td> <td>0.667</td></tr>
  <tr><td>SENet</td> <td>0.667</td></tr>
</table>
</td>
</table>

<p>  
  Just like before, the convolutional networks out-perform the MLP network.
  The convolutional networks have a higher average win rate against general opponents, suggesting that they learned a stronger heuristic than the fully connected network.
</p>

<p>
  As you might expect, as opponent strength increases, AlphaZero's win rate starts to decrease.
  Win rate converges to 50%, which makes sense since optimal Tic-Tac-Toe play is known to end in a tie.
  All of our networks seemed to learn how to force a tie, though the convolutional networks also learned how to exploit weaker opponents and pull off more wins.
</p>

<p>
  Recall from our hyperparameter discussion that our trained AlphaZero agents use 50 MCTS iterations per turn, guided by a deep heuristic.
  For comparison, we have also plotted a 50-iteration vanilla MCTS agent as a control in black. 
  For each opponent, our networks meet or beat the win rate of the control, showing that the learned heuristics are meaningful and superior to vanilla UCT.
</p>
  
<p>
  From these results, we see that our deep heuristic makes MCTS wildly more efficient compared to the vanilla MCTS UCT heuristic.

<h5> Filter Visualization </h5>
<p>
  Here are some visualizations of filters from the first convolutional layer of the Tic-Tac-Toe SENet.
  Strong red colors at indicate responses to the first player's pieces,
  and blue colors indicate responses to the second player's pieces.
  Purplish blends indicate responses to both.
  The semantic purpose of each filter is not obvious, but we do know
  these filters are extracting board patterns that are significant to making decisions.

<h5>Human Competitor</h5>
<p>
  The true test of an AlphaZero agent is its performance against a competent human opponent.
  Below is a table of human competitors who played against the Tic-Tac-Toe SENet AlphaZero agent, and the game outcomes.
  50% of the time the human played first, and 50% of the time the AI played first.
  Note that these are non-professional players. A win rate of 50% implies that the human is just as strong as the AI.

<h2>Experiments and Results: Connect-4</h2>
<h5>About Connect-4</h5>
<p>
  From Wikipedia:
  "Connect 4 is a two-player connection game in which the players first choose a color and then take turns dropping one colored disc from the top into a seven-column, six-row vertically suspended grid. The pieces fall straight down, occupying the lowest available space within the column. The objective of the game is to be the first to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of four of one's own discs. Connect Four is a solved game. The first player can always win by playing the right moves"
</p>

<h5> Training Error </h5>
<p>
  As with Tic-Tac-Toe, we can use training loss to gauge how well the networks learned from self-play data.
</p>
<center><img src="images/c4_error.png"></center>

<p>
  Unlike with Tic-Tac-Toe, not all of our loss curves decrease over iterations.
  Now, only the deep network appears to stably decrease, while the shallow MLP and CNN actually have increasing training error over iterations.
  We have a few theories as to why this is happening:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Model capacity is too small. The shallow networks are too simple to capture the complexity of Connect 4 play. Adding more parameters and layers might improve performance, as we see with SENet.</li>
    <li>Learning rate is too high. SENet uses batch normalization, while the other networks do not, potentially enabling it to train with a higher learning rate than the other networks.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
  Verifying these hypotheses requires more experimentation and is left as future work.
</p>
<h5> Generalized Performance </h5>
<p>
  The SENet has the lowest self-play training error, but we would like to know how well it generalizes compared to the other networks.
  We use the same methodology as with Tic-Tac-Toe to test how well the agent generalizes.
  The performance of these networks against increasingly stronger opponents is plotted below.
</p>

<p>
  Again, as you might expect, as opponent strength increases, AlphaZero's win rate starts to decrease.
  Contrary to what we saw with Tic-Tac-Toe, we do not appear to converge to an optimal solution.
  As mentioned earlier, Connect-4 is a solved game - the first player can force a win.
  If both AlphaZero and the benchmark were playing optimally, we would expected win rate to converge to 50% (win when playing first, lose when playing second, therefore winning half the games).
  However, that is not what we are seeing. For each of the networks, our win rate hits 0% - if our agents were playing optimally, this would never happen.
  Even though we did not converge on optimal play, we still learned a very strong heuristic. See the Human Competitor section for a demonstration.
</p>

<p>
  Surprisingly, all networks perform about the same against vanilla MCTS opponents. Despite training error diverging for the shallower networks, they generalize just as well as SENet.
  This is definitely a surprising result.
</p>

<p>
  Again, we plot a 50-iteration vanilla MCTS agent control agent in black for comparison. 
  At each opponent, our networks meet or beat the win rate of the control.
  This shows that even though we failed to learn the optimal strategy, we still learned a heuristic that is strictly better than UCT.
  Even with our current heuristic, if we allow our MCTS to perform more than 50 iterations (800 was used for Go), we will likely converge on optimal play, though we would require more thinking time.
  Mastery is just a matter learning a smarter heuristic through more training time and hyperparameter tuning.
</p>
  
<h5> Filter Visualization </h5>
<p>
  Here are some visualizations of filters from the first convolutional layer of the Connect 4 SENet.
  As before, strong red colors at indicate responses to the first player's pieces, blue colors indicate responses to the second player's pieces, and purplish blends indicate responses to both.
  Again, the semantic purpose of each filter is not immediately clear, but we do know they are definitely extracting board patterns that are significant to making decisions during game-play.
