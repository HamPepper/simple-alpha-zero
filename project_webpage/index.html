<h2>Abstract</h2>
<!-- 
One or two sentences on the motivation behind the problem you are solving. 
One or two sentences describing the approach you took. 
One or two sentences on the main result you obtained. -->

<p> We were inspired by the work done by DeepMind on AlphaZero - an algorithm developed to play games by simply using the rules of the game, without any prior knowledge or example expert-played games. The AlphaZero algorithm uses a combination of deep neural networks and reinforcement learning and is a generalization of the AlphaGo Zero algorithm (used specifically for the game of Go). </p>

<p> AlphaZero leverages the Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm in order to traverse through various promising game states. We opted to mimic this approach, and test it on smaller games such as Tic-Tac-Toe and Connect 4. Our implementation of AlphaZero was built complete from scratch. </p>

<p> TO DO: MAIN RESULTS. </p>

<h2> Introduction and Motivation </h2>
<h4>What did you try to do? What problem did you try to solve? Articulate your objectives using absolutely no jargon.</h4>
<p>Our goal was to independently replicate the implementation of AlphaZero and test it out on games such as Tic-Tac-Toe and Connect-4. Since the algorithm is generalized, the same algorithm can be plugged into any discrete, deterministic game with perfect information, and should be able to find powerful policies through self-play. Just like the results of the original paper, we wanted to show that the algorithm would be able to learn how to play (and win!) the game based on solely its associated rules. We would not provide the algorithm with any other information such as game trajectories by grandmasters etc.</p>

<h4>How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?</h4>
<p>Currently, AlphaZero is at the forefront of systems that can learn by itself (i.e. through self-play) and master highly complex games (such as Chess and Go). Stockfish has also been known to dabble in this field, but their results have not been as impressive as AlphaZero. In fact, in a match of 100 games, AlphaZero beat Stockfish 64-36, a landslide victory. We do note though that there have been doubts about the validity of these claims. AlphaZero's key benefit lies in the fact that it does not require masses of data and can self-learn how to play the game. Combined with the increase in computational power now available, training the network to play a game of choice has almost become straightforward. Nobody has yet been able to replicate the results that DeepMind achieved. </p>

<p> Connect 4 and tictactoe being solved; different searches (Alpha Beta, Minimax) check paper; we cannot replicate because TPU not available; </p>

<h4>Who cares? If you are successful, what difference will it make?</h4>
<p> As mentioned before, our goal was to implement the AlphaZero algorithm from scratch. We believe that the implementation is far more accessible and modular, and it is well-tested. In the code bank, there is a test bed that can be scaled up (perhaps using TPUs). Having this set up will also provide good headway for future research - testing different types of deep nets, introducing multi-player etc.</p>

<p> Modular (swap out the game and swap out the network) </p>

<p> TO DO: Multi-Player? Talk about the SENet etc.? </p>

<br><br>
<h2> Background: Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)</h2>
<p> The AlphaZero algorithm uses MCTS for policy improvement and competetive play. AlphaZero improves upon basic MCTS by introducing a deep heuristic during search. We first wanted to understand how basic, uninformed MCTS works. OVERVIEW SENTENCE.

The algorithm works with games that are discrete, deterministic and have perfect information - this means that they must have distinct moves and positions, have fixed outcomes for each move, players must compete against one another but can see everything that happens. </p>

<p> The search tree always begins by expanding the game's starting state s<sub>init</sub>, by considering every possible action. For a game like Tic-Tac-Toe this initial state would be an empty 3 by 3 board, and a possible action would be placing an X in the center slot. The diagram below shows how this first step works for a state further down the Tic-Tac-Toe game tree. </p>

<br><br>

<p> Each of these new child nodes is then played out by making random moves until a final state (winning, losing or tying) is reached. These finals states have associated scores - wins get +1, ties get 0 and losses get -1. Reaching an outcome (win/loss/tie) through random play gives us an indication as to how promising a state is. One example of playing out a child state is shown below. </p>

TO DO: edge, re do diagrams

<p> The value of the node (W) and the number of play outs that have been executed (N) is stored for each edge. These values are then sent up through the tree and contribute to the W and N of the parent node. The accumulated values are stored for the parent node. These steps are shown below.</p>

<br><br>

<p> This combination of expanding nodes, unravelling their value and the propagating the information upwards occurs over multiple iterations. The algorithm does not expand all the leaf nodes (this would be very computationally expensive), and instead it chooses nodes that balance between having high estimated values (W) and having low visit counts (N). MCTS chooses to expand the leaf with the highest upper confidence tree score (UCT) - the equation is shown below. </p>

<div style="text-align: center;">
<img style="height: 100px;" alt="" src="images/mcts5.png">
</div>
<br><br>

<p> Having a low value for c wil encourage the algorithm to choose nodes with a high W, while a low c value will encourage the search to pick nodes with a low N to explore. The value of c is often set empirically. The W<sub>i</sub> and N<sub>i</sub> correspond to the accumulated value and the visit count for the i<sup>th</sup> child. N<sub>p</sub> is the visit count of the parent node. At c = 1, the UCT score's for the Tic-Tac-Toe tree we have been following are shown below: </p>

<div style="text-align: center;">
<img style="height: 400px;" alt="" src="images/mcts6.png">
</div>
<br><br>

<p> Since state s<sub>0, 1</sub> has the highest UCT score, it is picked first to explore. As before, it is expanded, and the values are propagated back through the tree. In this example, the W value reflects player X's wins and losses. The algorithm keeps track of the current player (and flips the sign of W whenever the players switch). </p>

<div style="text-align: center;">

</div>
<br><br>

<p> The MCTS will continue to run multiple iterations until time runs out. Based on the chosen and tuned parameters, the tree goes through a good balance of expansion and exploration to eventually identify the best move to make. Then in the original game, the first child with the highest N value is picked. If the final tree looked like the one below, the algorithm would choose the action that led to s<sub>0, 1</sub>. </p>
